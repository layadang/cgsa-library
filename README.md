# CGSA Library Database

This project was created for the Center for Gender, Sexuality & Activism (CGSA) at Boston University. We aims to develop an accessibile web app for students, staff, and visitors of the CGSA to see available books in the library. As the center is entirely student-run, the donated books have not been documented and there are currently no efficient check-out system. This project will address these issues by implementing a user-friendly solution.

## Functionality 

By the end of the project, we aim to:
* deploy a live site
* build a NoSQL database with every book's title, ISBN, author, cover, and summary
* users with @bu.edu emails are able to request to check-out books
* every book can be browsed 
* CGSA E-board members are able to add more books to the database when needed
