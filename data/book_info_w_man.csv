After all, we have banned discrimination against women, required equal pay for equal work, and adopted family-leave legislation. But the fact is that we have a two-tiered system, where some working women have a full panoply of rights while others have few or none at all. We allow blatant discrimination by small employers. Domestic workers are cut out of our wage and overtime laws. Part-time workers, disproportionately women, are denied basic benefits. Laws are written through a process of compromise and negotiation, and in each case vulnerable workers were the bargaining chip that was sacrificed to guarantee the policy\'s enactment. For these workers, the system that was supposed to act as a safety net has become a sieve-and they are still falling through. Caroline Fredrickson is a powerful advocate and D.C. insider who has witnessed the legislative compromises that leave out temps, farmworkers, employees of small businesses, immigrants, and other workers who fall outside an intentionally narrow definition of ""employees."" The women in this fast-growing part of the workforce are denied minimum wage, maternity leave, health care, the right to unionize, and protection from harassment and discrimination-all within the bounds of the law. If current trends continue, their fate will be the future of all American workers. ""-",gender studies

Beautiful, self-assured Ifemelu heads for America, where despite her academic success she is forced to grapple with what it means to be black for the first time. Quiet, thoughtful Obinze had hoped to join her, but with post—9/11 America closed to him, he instead plunges into a danger- ous, undocumented life in London. At once powerful and tender, Americanah is a remarkable novel of race, love, and identity by the award-winning writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichte.\r\n--back cove",other

Some even argued that the massacres and outrages on both sides were too horrific to ""deserve the name of a war."""".\n\n""It all began when Philip (called Metacom by his own people), the leader of the Wampanoag Indians, led attacks against English towns in the colony of Plymouth. The war spread quickly, pitting a loose confederation of southeastern Algonquians against a coalition of English colonists. While it raged, colonial armies pursued enemy Indians through the swamps and woods of New England, and Indians attacked English farms and towns from Narragansett Bay to the Connecticut River Valley.\n\nBoth sides, in fact, had pursued the war seemingly without restraint, killing women and children, torturing captives, and mutilating the dead. The fighting ended after Philip was shot, quartered, and beheaded in August 1676."".\n\n""The war\'s brutality compelled the colonists to defend themselves against accusations that they had become savages. But Jill Lepore makes clear that it was after the war - and because of it - that the boundaries between cultures, hitherto blurred, turned into rigid ones. King Philip\'s War became one of the most written-about wars in our history, and Lepore argues that the words strengthened and hardened feelings that, in turn, strengthened and hardened the enmity between Indians and Anglos.\n\nShe shows how, as late as the nineteenth century, memories of the war were instrumental in justifying Indian removals - and how in our own century that same war has inspired Indian attempts to preserve ""Indianness"" as fiercely as the early settlers once struggled to preserve their Englishness.""--BOOK JACKET",other

Now, in a visually rich and deeply inspiring book, movement leaders and activists distill their wisdom, sharing lessons of what works and what hinders transformative social change. Weaving together interviews with today\'s most successful activists--from Bill McKibben and Clayton Thomas Muller to Karen Lewis, Rinku Sen, Ai-jen Poo, Favianna Rodriguez, Rea Carey, Gaby Pacheco, Patrice Collins, and more--with narrative recountings of strategies and campaigns alongside full-color photos and an afterword by Antonia Darder, social activist Greg Jobin-Leeds joins forces with AgitArte, an organization of artists and organizers, to document the stories, philosophy, tactics, and art of today\'s leading social change movements. Beautifully packaged in a wonderfully affordable paperback edition, When We Fight, We Win! will allow a whole generation of readers to celebrate and benefit from a remarkable decade of activism and reform.

Hailed by the Washington Post as ""one of the most visible and successful feminists of her generation,"" Jessica Valenti has been leading the national conversation on gender and politics for over a decade. Now, in a memoir that Publishers Weekly calls ""bold and unflinching,"" Valenti explores the toll that sexism takes on women\'s lives, from the everyday to the existential. From subway gropings and imposter syndrome to sexual awakenings and motherhood, Sex Object reveals the painful, embarrassing, and sometimes illegal moments that shaped Valenti\'s adolescence and young adulthood in New York City. In the tradition of writers like Joan Didion and Mary Karr, Sex Object is a profoundly moving tour de force that is bound to shock those already familiar with Valenti\'s work, and enthrall those who are just finding it.--\n\n""Guardian US columnist Jessica Valenti has been leading that national conversation for over a decade and is widely credited with sparking the new wave of the women\'s movement. When Jessica launched Feministing.com in 2004, it quickly became the most popular feminist site online not just because of Valenti\'s news acumen and analysis, but because of her humor, frankness, and willingness to open up about her own life and struggles. At the Guardian US, Valenti\'s wildly popular column currently garners over 1M monthly views and she is frequently their most ""shared"" author. She is frequent commentator on national television and a heavily requested speaker. With Sex Object, Valenti moves away from politics and policy focusing instead on funny, painful, embarrassing, and sometimes illegal moments from her life that tell a broader story about modern womanhood. Structured in three acts to follow the arc of a woman\'s life, BODIES, BOYS, BABIES, the stories that highlight the book are about drugs, sex, harassment, assault, bad boyfriends, too-nice boyfriends, abortions, birth, class anxiety, impostor syndrome, death threats, resistance, and family. Valenti has authored a few books with smaller presses including Full Frontal Feminist (46k LTD) but this is the first time she is being published by a major publisher. With its controversial subject matter (there is a highly detailed chapter about getting an abortion), Sex Object is bound to make waves the same way Fear of Flying did in the \'70s; We keep hearing the feminism is ""having a moment""- luckily, we are publishing the leader of the pack""-",gender studies

She details the story of how a resourceful and dedicated minority transformed the notion of American marriage equality and forged a campaign for cultural change that will serve as a model for all future political movements. In the vein of Taylor Branch's book, Parting of the Waters, this book is the story of a massive shift in American culture. It offers an insider's view of the crucial struggle that is leading to change, incorporating her experiences and insights and drawing upon new interviews with movement titans such as Frank Kameny and Phyllis Lyon, with next-generation activists such as Evan Wolfson of Freedom to Marry, and with allies including the likes of New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, to create a comprehensive, inspiring history of change in our time",history

These once controversial phenomena are now widely accepted along with the recognition that the media are a major socializer of youth. During the economic boom of the post-World War II era, marketers and advertisers identified adolescents as a major audience, which led to the emergence of a pervasive youth culture. Enormous changes ensued in the media's portrayal of adolescents and the behaviors they emulate. These changes were spurred by increased availability and consumption of television, which joined radio, film, and magazines as major influence on youth. Later, the rapid growth of the video game industry and the internet contributed to the encompassing presence of the media. Today, opportunities for youthful expression about to the point where adolescents can easily create and disseminate content with little control by traditional media gatekeepers. In this book leading scholars analyze the emergence of youth culture in music and powerful trends in gender and ethnic-racial representation, sexuality, substance use, violence, and suicide portrayed in the media. This book illuminates the evolution of teen portrayal, the potential consequences of these changes, and the ways policy-makers and parents can respond",other

Over a decade into the United States\' ""global war on terror,"" PTSD afflicts as many as 30 percent of the conflict\'s veterans. But the disorder\'s reach extends far beyond the armed forces.

Beginning with the impact of the abuses inflicted on Native American children at state-sanctioned boarding schools from the 1880s to the 1980s, Smith adroitly expands our conception of violence to include the widespread appropriation of Indian cultural practices by whites and other non-Natives; environmental racism; and population control. Smith deftly connects these and other examples of historical and contemporary colonialism to the high rates of violence against Native American women -- the most likely to suffer from poverty-related illness and to survive rape and partner abuse. Smith also outlines radical and innovative strategies for eliminating gendered violence""--Back cover",history
